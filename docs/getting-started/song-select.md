## What Song Should I Pick First?
If you know a song in this game, I recommend starting out with that first. Knowing a song helps a lot with getting used to the game since you're familiar with the song's general rhythm.

Otherwise, continue reading.

### Folders
Like other rhythm games, DRS uses a folder system to cateogrize its songlist.

It's not a bad idea to hover around the Lesson or EASY folders as a beginner.

Lessons act as tutorials for the various steps and patterns in the game. They usually end with a recommended song to practice what you just learned. This is great for starting since you'll get used to the motions of each step and get some songs to apply your newly learned knowledge.

The EASY folder contains songs that the developers consider are beginner friendly. Typically, these are songs that give a nice entry to point to get a feel for the game.

Otherwise the remaining folders are categorized by:
- Event (only if there is an ongoing limited-time event).
- Genre:
  - POPS (pop music)
  - EDM
  - Bemani
- All Music:
  - Sorted alphabetically by song title.
  - Sorted alphabetically by artist name.
- Levels 1-10.

### Recommended Songs

## Charts and Difficulty
DRS difficulties range from 1-10. Each song has two difficulty charts: Easy and Normal.
- Easy ranges from 1-5.
- Normal ranges from 6-10. 

## Scroll Speed
Similar to other rhythm games, you can adjust scroll speed in song select or in-game.

*insert options menu pic here*

To change the scroll speed option in the song select menu, hold the start button until a menu pops up. Scroll to SPEED and use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the speed. There are other options, but we'll go over them later.

*insert game screen w scroll speed highlighted pic here*

To change the scroll speed option in game, press the up and down arrow keys to adjust the speed. You will have a brief period once the song loads to be able to change the speed without interrupting your play session. If you need to, however, you can also adjust this during the song.
