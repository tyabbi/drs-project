## Navigating the Menu
Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the list.

## What Song Should I Pick First?
If you know a song in this game, I recommend starting out with that first. Knowing a song helps a lot with getting used to the game since you're familiar with the song's general rhythm.

Otherwise, continue reading.

### Folders
It's not a bad idea to hover around the Lesson or EASY folders.

Lessons act as tutorials for the various steps and patterns in the game. They usually end with a recommended song to practice what you just learned. 

Otherwise the remaining folders are categorized by:
- Event (only if there is an ongoing limited-time event).
- Genre:
  - POPS (pop music)
  - EDM
  - Bemani
- All Music:
  - Sorted alphabetically by song title.
  - Sorted alphabetically by artist name.
- Levels 1-10.

### Recommended Songs

## Charts and Difficulty
DRS difficulties range from 1-10. Each song has two difficulty charts: Easy and Normal.
- Easy ranges from 1-5.
- Normal ranges from 6-10. 

## Scroll Speed
Similar to other rhythm games, you can adjust scroll speed in song selct or in-game.
