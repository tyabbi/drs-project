## Starting the Game
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

## The e-Amusement Card
An e-amusement card will let you save your progress. Notably, you will be able to track your high scores and have access to unlockable songs/limited time events. A lot of songs are locked from the start, so it's highly recommended to get a card if you want to dedicate time to this game.

If your arcade has e-amusement service, they probably sell the cards. They are usually between $5 to $10.

## Scanning Your Card
Scan your card on the cab's card reader shown below.

## Creating a Player Profile

## Selecting a Mode
### Number of Players
First off, choose the number of players.

*insert player select pic here*

- 1 Player: The most common way to play. You get full access to the pad. Highly recommend playing alone when starting out.
- 2 Players: Two players playing on the same pad. One player gets the front half of the pad, the other player plays on the back half.
- Battle: Two DRS cabinets sync up in a competitive mode where the highest score wins. Up to four players can play.

You can also change the menu language on this page using the left and right arrows keys.

### Mode Select
After choosing the number of players, choose what mode to play.

- LIGHT/STANDARD:
  - LIGHT: In LIGHT Mode, you get two songs.
  - STANDARD: In STANDARD Mode, you get two songs, but scoring higher than 180,000 points in those two songs gives you a third song and access to EXTRA STAGE exclusive songs. We will cover this more later.
- Premium: In PREMIUM Mode, you only get one song, but the cabinet records your play session. We will cover this more later. 

## Limited Time Events
After your selection, there might be a popup or cutscene for either a stamp song or an event. Don't worry about it for now, we'll cover it later in the guide.
