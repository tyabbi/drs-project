## Beginner Steps

## Basic Moves

Here, we'll go over some of the basic, fundamental patterns in the game and show what moves you can apply. Most of these moves will be aimed towards beginners. Go to the Advanced page for some harder patterns and flashier steps.

## Basic Steps
The standard rhythm game notes. DANCERUSH calls them TAPs and SLIDEs. 

### TAP

By default, TAPs have a designated L or R label to guide you on which leg to use. This doesn't matter. You can use whatever you want, really. It's nice to have a guide, though. There's nothing wrong with just stepping when you're starting out. When you're feeling up to it, check out the Running Man section below for another way to approach TAPs.

Don't forget about double notes! 
### SLIDE

SLIDEs are just long notes. Keep your foot down for as long as the note lasts. As the name suggests, you may have to keep your foot on the pad while moving it during the duration of the note.  

Overall, focus on your timing and absorb the rhythm of the song with these notes. Getting the rhythm down will help your timing with the rest of the steps. Don't be afraid to twist and turn your body to hit these notes. Also, don't just move left and right. You've got the whole pad to play with.

If you want to start getting fancy, head over to the Advanced page.

## JUMP

Jump over the JUMP note when it reaches the judgement line. Kinda like jump rope. It may help to time and control your jumps just in case there's a note immediately after.

## DOWN

Crouch down when the DOWN note reaches the judgement line. One of the fun/funny parts of the game. Since the cabinet uses a camera to detect this, you can really do any motion.

There's a meter at the top left of the screen to indicate downward motions for this note. Pay attention to it at first and kinda play around to see what counts as a DOWN, but you'll pick it up quickly.

Crouch down, swing your arm down, do a body roll, start B-Boying. Whatever gets the job done.

## Running Man

This is the foundation of the game. Get used to properly doing a running man. It will help a lot with flowing into other steps.
