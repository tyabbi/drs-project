## Tips for Improving

### Practice Fundamentals

Kinda obvious, but identify and learn the fundamentals. Get comfortable with the visuals and motions of the moves listed in Beginner Steps. It will help you recognize common patterns and make the transition to harder charts a lot better.

### Try Not to be Too Stiff

It's ok to be stiff in the beginning. You're learning.

Once you're comfortable with the steps, focus on your flow of movement. Try your best not to stop moving between steps. Twist your body away from the screen.

### Watch a lot of Stuff

Watching others play the game will expose you to a lot of different aspects of the game: playstyles, songs you wouldn't think of playing, new moves. Look out for regulars at your local arcade and watch some YouTube videos.

Similarly, watch how people shuffle dance. There's no shortage of resources online to learn how.

Lastly, watch yourself! Record your play sessions and watch them to see what you can improve on. 

Whatever looks cool or speaks to you, find something to inspire you.  

## Find How You Want to Play

Now's the best time to find out how you want to play. Typically, its either playing for style or playing for score. You can even do both. Do whatever you find fun.

## Miscellaneous Tips
- Accessing the options menu during song select adds 20 seconds to the song select timer.
