## Unlocking Songs
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

There are a lot of songs that require unlocking. This section will cover the different kinds of unlockable songs.

## Star Unlocks
All unlock songs require stars to unlock them.

### The Star System
Stars (★) act as the currency for unlocking songs in this game. Stars are generally earned by playing the game. The amount of stars you earn depend on both score and mode. The distribution is as follows:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

| Score            | Light        | Standard     | Premium      |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 00.000 - 29.999  | 1            | 2            | 6            |
| 30.000 - 59.999  | 2            | 3            | 12           |
| 60.000 - 79.999  | 3            | 4            | 18           |
| 80.000 - 89.999  | 4            | 5            | 24           |
| 90.000 - 100.000 | 5            | 6            | 30           |

</div>

The maximum number of Stars you can have at any time is 200.

### Discounts
Songs that need to be unlocked with stars each have a set of 3 Discount Missions. Completing...
- 1 Mission = 10% discount
- 2 Missions = 25% dicount
- 3 Missions = 50% discount

Missions can be completed in any order.

You can find a full list of unlockable songs [here](https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS/Stars_Unlocks).

## Discover Missions
Discover Mission songs are a special type of unlock song that requires completing a prerequisite mission to become visible and a set of 3 Discover Missions to be able to purchase. Once these songs are able to purchase, Discount Missions become available.

You can find a full list of Discover Mission songs and their requirements [here](https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS/Discover_Missions).

## EXTRA STAGE
EXTRA STAGE is only available in STANDARD Mode. To access EXTRA STAGE, you must score a combined total of at least 180.000 points in your first two songs.

Upon accessing EXTRA STAGE, a new EXTRA STAGE folder becomes available. This folder contains songs exclusive to EXTRA STAGE. Clearing an exclusive song makes it purchasable for play outside of EXTRA STAGE. 

A full list of EXTRA STAGE songs can be found [here](https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS/Stars_Unlocks#EXTRA_STAGE_Songs).

## Limited Time Events
Some songs are only available to unlock from different limited time events. This guide will cover the recurring/relevant events since most of the events only happened once. On top of that, a good amount of the event only songs are now accessible as regular Star Unlocks.

A full list of events in detail can be found [here](https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS#DANCERUSH_STARDOM_events).

### Events (SPARK FESTIVAL, GYM, etc.)
During specific events, multiple songs can be unlocked during the duration of the event. The requirements to progress are slightly different for each event, but most events require a decent amount of play time to fully complete.

### Stamp Bonus 
For a limited time, some songs can be unlocked by obtaining 9 stamps within the allotted time period. Stamps are given on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th play sessions of the day, meaning you can only get a maximum of 3 stamps a day.

A full list of Stamp Bonus songs can be found [here](https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS#Stamp_Bonus).

### RANDOM CHALLENGE
For a limited time, some songs are hidden behind the RANDOM SELECT song option. Clearing these kinds of songs will make it appear as a DISCOVER MISSION, which can then be subsequently unlocked after fulfilling its prerequisities.
