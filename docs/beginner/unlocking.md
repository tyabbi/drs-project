## Unlocking Songs
{: .fs-9 .no_toc }

There are a lot of songs that require unlocking. This section will cover specifically songs that can be unlocked at all times. Information on stamp songs and limited time event songs can be found here.

## Star Unlocks
All unlock songs require stars to unlock them.

### The Star System
Stars (â˜…) act as the currency for unlocking songs in this game. Stars are generally earned by playing the game. The amount of stars you earn depend on both score and mode. The distribution is as follows:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
| Score            | Light        | Standard     | Premium      |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 00.000 - 29.999  | 1            | 2            | 6            |
| 30.000 - 59.999  | 2            | 3            | 12           |
| 60.000 - 79.999  | 3            | 4            | 18           |
| 80.000 - 89.999  | 4            | 5            | 24           |
| 90.000 - 100.000 | 5            | 6            | 30           |

The maximum number of Stars you can have at any time is 200.

### Discounts
Songs that need to be unlocked with stars each have a set of 3 Discount Missions. Completing...
- 1 Mission = 10% discount
- 2 Missions = 25% dicount
- 3 Missions = 50% discount

Missions can be completed in any order.

## Discover Missions
Discover Mission songs are a special type of unlock song that requires completing a prerequisite mission to become visible and a set of 3 Discover Missions to be able to purchase. Once these songs are able to purchase, Discount Missions become available.

## EXTRA STAGE
EXTRA STAGE is only available in STANDARD Mode. To access EXTRA STAGE, you must score a combined total of at least 180.000 points in your first two songs.

Upon accessing EXTRA STAGE, a new EXTRA STAGE folder becomes available. This folder contains songs exclusive to EXTRA STAGE. Clearing an exclusive song makes it purchasable for play outside of EXTRA STAGE.
